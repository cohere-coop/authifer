# Authifer

`Trust me Authifer, I'm not half as think as you drunk I am!`

One obstacles to chiseling away a monolithic application architecture is
managing user authentication on several smaller apps.

Authifer abstracts authentication into it's own application so you can focus
your attention on adding useful features for your customers instead of managing
user identities.

## Usage

Gimme a second. I'll figure it out.
